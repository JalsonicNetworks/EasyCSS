===================

The foundational EasyCSS removes the inconsistent styling of HTML elements provided by browsers. This creates a dependably flat foundation to build upon. With EasyCSS loaded, write explicit CSS your project needs.

Include Dependencies
----------------------

To use EasyCSS, include the following source file in your web page:

	```html
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">
	```

Works Everywhere
